###Udacity FEND Project 2

This project is a webpage of a landing page. It is the second project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree that requires
us to react to user events to update the UI. Specifically, this page contains sections and a nav bar. When you select an item on the nav bar the page scrolls to the corresponding section.

There are no dependencies for this project so you should be able to run this in the browser w/out installing any external packages.
